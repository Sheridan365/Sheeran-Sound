# Sheeran Sounds

This website is for a production company that works with clients from all around the world.
 
## UX
 
 My goal for this design was to make information accessible with the click of a finger as well as trying to keep it clean but functionable.

 Before starting my project i used balsamiq Mockups to layout the basic structure of my website this was helpfull when it came to coding time see mockup link below.
