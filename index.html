                                First of all Sheeran Sounds was once a dream i had as a young boy. I started out in the
                                basement of my family home with a pen, paper and a desk. I started writing songs and
                                eventually i had about 30 songs wrote and i went to visit a music producer and he was
                                able to successfully locate artists willing to sing my music. After that i was earning
                                about €10.00 per album sold i had enough money to buy a small office.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p-4">
                                After successfully opening my office i was requested by the producer to write more
                                songs. So i did i sat long days and even worked throughout the night and i eventually
                                had written 200 songs. At this stage i had requested i make €200.00 per album sold.
                                After this i had enough money saved to start recruiting and expanding the business.
